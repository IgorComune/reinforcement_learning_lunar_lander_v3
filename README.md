# Gymnasium - Lunar Lander v3

## Both Discrete and Continuous problems were solved using PyTorch Agents.

# Setup
* WSL Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS
* Anaconda
* Python 3.10.12
* Git clone
* pip install requirements

# Execution
* Inside `SRC` folder you'll find both types of problem: `continuous` and `discrete`
* You'll just need to run the files, they are meant to be executed independently.
